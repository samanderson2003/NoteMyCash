# 📒 Finote  
*Talk it. Track it. Done.*  

---

## 📌 Overview  
**Finote** is a **voice-first expense and investment tracker** designed for quick and effortless financial logging.  
Powered by **OpenAI Whisper API**, it lets you speak your transactions in natural language and instantly turns them into **organized, clean, timestamped, and location-marked** daily logs — complete with **CRUD** support.  

---

## 💡 Why This App Was Built  
Most expense trackers require manual typing, which is inconvenient when you’re on the move.  

**Scenario:**  
You’re riding your bike, stopping at different shops. Instead of typing:  
> "Bought vegetables for 120 rupees at grocery store."  
> "Bought milk for 40 rupees at dairy shop."  

You just **speak**, and Finote automatically logs each entry with **time, date, and location** in your daily note.
